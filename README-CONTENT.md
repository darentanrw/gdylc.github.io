About HC-GDYLC 
The inaugural edition of the Hwa Chong - Global Digital Young Leaders Convention aims to be a unique platform for delegates from all corners of the world to conference and collaborate. Delegates can look forward to a 7 day conference where they immerse themselves in an alternate reality, responding to a pandemic where they take on roles of various stakeholders in the crisis and work together despite seemingly conflicting interests to overcome the various challenging problems embedded in the crisis, engaging in fruitful discussion and collaboration to resolve the crisis together. 

Given its fully digital nature, the organising team of the convention wishes for delegates to challenge the boundaries of global conventions and technology, to engage in open and transparent discussions. Through the convention, we sincerely hope delegates are not only able to develop global competencies such as problem solving and collaboration, but also widen their perspectives, understanding how different stakeholders are affected in a crisis  and the complexities of society in a macro and micro level beyond what is taught in the confines of the classroom. Lastly, we hope that delegates can apply their knowledge and experience in their lives and take concrete action to make a positive impact on their society.

We wish all delegates a pleasant and meaningful experience during the Hwa Chong - Global Digital Young Leaders Convention. More importantly, stay safe, and stay healthy.

The logo of the Hwa Chong Global Digital Young Leaders’ Convention (HC-GDYLC) explores the concept of identity in our VUCA world. GDYLC takes on a bold yet ever-relevant ideology of using technology to dimensionally reimagine the way we connect with one another, a vision that is represented succinctly using the motif of the thumbprint in the logo.
 
A thumbprint is a felicitous emblem of biometrics - today, it is a common digital tool to ensure our safety and security, a testament to an elegant coalescence between our modern mastery of technology and our longstanding, fundamental human biology. Framing the silhouettes of Earth’s continents, the thumbprint is also a commanding symbol of our shared identity - as global citizens, it is necessary for us to navigate our shared adversities together. The red core of the thumbprint, besides representing Singapore as ‘the Little Red Dot’, highlights the position of all delegates as global citizens - the centre of a vast, international identity, with roots no longer bound in traditional geography. Our boundaries have, with the emergence of technology, dissolved to give rise to new alliances and new fault lines in the world today. Our humanity is no longer defined by our continents and seas, but instead by the new, abstract identities and perspectives we can create and the changes and impact that we choose to make together. Consequently, a global identity defines our future - and technology is already present, a ready platform through which we can chart our paths. These are precisely the grounds that the novel convention format of GDYLC was born - in adversity and diversity, and humanity needs to find its footing with a new identity in concord.
 
The thumbprint has now become the new passport to the world for our young global leaders. Let us stand in solidarity, charter a new era and aim to leave a lasting imprint in our respective nations and beyond.

                    <p>The theme for the inaugural Hwa Chong Global Digital Young Leaders Convention (HC-GDYLC) is Concord: Standing in Solidarity, Chartering a New Era. Just as musical notes in concord come together to form a distinct harmony, a dynamic mix of people come forth during HC-GDYLC to reimagine our world, assembling individual perspectives into a powerful and inspiring global mosaic —  all while transcending the physical barriers of geography and time zones.</p>

					<p>In times of global adversity — not just the oft-cited COVID-19 health crisis, but even long-standing issues like terrorism, trade conflict and climate change - insular ideologies will only prove to be to our detriment. The world is in a precarious position: clouded by fear and often influenced by the deluge of misinformation, the propensity for blaming an outgroup instead of mitigating the real problem is very high. Leaders of some countries fail to realise that our interconnectedness means that the problem of one group will invariably become a global issue as well. In order to minimise the global impact of a crisis, all countries need to realise that synergistic cooperation is key to effective problem-solving, rather than the blame game.</p>

					<p>However, all hope is not lost. The current situation is certainly less bleak than it seems, with many standing in solidarity to confront the problems plaguing the world today, all whilst reinventing the necessary methods seeming to belong to a bygone era. An increasing number of progressive young leaders are taking over the political helm, shaping policies in accordance with the world’s changing priorities. The world’s youngest Prime Minister, Sanna Marin of Finland, has recently shed new light on climate reform, pioneering the idea of how the fight against climate change need not be a burden, but can instead be transformed into a budding economic opportunity. With fresh-faced leaders establishing their revolutionary visions for the next decade, it ignites the confidence that we are capable of forging the best way forward. </p>

					<p>In response to a less top-down approach to governance, those on the ground need to harness the benefits of a more transparent and open democracy by bringing their ideas to the forefront. With nations governed by experienced politicians with decades of experience, comes a challenge: conformity to existing ideologies and the inevitable inertia in enacting systemic change. The new generation of inspiring youth activists plays an increasingly vital role in spurring change in unison around the world. "I want you to act like your house is on fire, because it is." said Greta Thunberg at the World Economic Forum last year. The 17 year old face of the environmentalist movement has spearheaded climate strikes of unprecedented scale, uniting millions of youth to demand bold climate action from political leaders. The voices of youth have incontrovertibly been amplified, and their concerns have been heard as they helm global movements that command the world’s attention. On the surface, youth activism promises a deviation from the conformist ideologies of politics and a passion for implementing changes that may very well disrupt the intricate process of governance. Are we ready for a series of changes that may intrude upon peace and stability we currently enjoy? How effective has youth activism been in translating thought into concrete political action from the authorities? Despite the ascendancy of environmentalism, COP25 concluded in disappointment as conflicting nations failed to agree on many intended outcomes, such as rules to set up a global carbon trading system. In attempting to resolve any crisis which lies ahead, promises must transcend rhetoric and actualise through tangible goals in order to truly engender positive changes. </p>

					<p>The struggle between pursuing economic growth or committing ourselves to fulfilling the buzzword of ‘global sustainability’ appears to be yet another unsolvable quandary. Yet, the unexpected crisis of COVID-19 seems to have given us the perfect answer to this paradoxical argument. When a crisis strikes, those on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder are often hit the hardest, triggering a chain reaction that comes at the high cost of our economic health. Numbers indicative absolute growth can no longer justify the fact that our economic system is built on increasingly shaky foundations that  will collapse if threatened. 80% of the world’s energy used for economic development still overwhelmingly relies on burning fossil fuels - the main perpetrator of global warming, which could very well escalate into the next crisis after this pandemic. Societies can find a way out of archaic economic strategies, by means of expanding green industries and adopting responsible production practices. Low-skilled workers can longer be the main outlet of productivity in our industry, instead, innovation and upskilling is key to revitalise our economy.While this may come at a financial cost at first, such investments have significant pay-offs in the long-run. </p>

					<p>Education is another frontier in the long road towards sustainability. Through the COVID-19 crisis, an alarming faultline in our societies has been revealed: The Digital Divide. In our increasingly digital and interconnected world, failure to possess technology with access to the Internet has never been so consequential. The uneven distribution in the access to, use of, or impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has highlighted the gulf between the privileged and underprivileged, hindering the growth and development opportunities of those who lack access. In efforts to increase the accessibility of education worldwide, increasing partnerships and collaboration could hold the key to the problem, especially in developing countries. In Kenya, the Information Communication and Technology Trust Fund was set up to mobilise and channel ICT resources to Kenyan educational institutions. Funded by private sector partners including Microsoft, it was implemented with the coordination of government, as well as members of the public, helping to greatly increase accessibility of education to children across the nation. Providing more children with education is to provide not just the children, but their families a path to break out of the cycle of poverty as they grow up educated with the competencies to work in better-paying skills-based jobs. Post COVID-19, the face of societies will change. Education will no longer be about preparing students to take tests set by bureaucrats who are not fully aware of the complexities of society. By involving businesses who better understand the working world, we can empower and enable students to be more prepared for the uncertain future. The future is now. It is of the essence that numerous stakeholders are involved in providing education to ensure wider perspectives are considered to create more rounded curricula that better prepare future generations of the world for the journey ahead.</p>

					<p>The new decade brings the promise of actualising lofty ambitions, but we must ensure that these goals are carried out with sufficient follow-through. The time is now for us youths to put ourselves in the shoes of key stakeholders, taking on the mantle to explore novel solutions and create robust systems. In this new decade, we must tap on our global partnerships to stand in solidarity, while upholding the universal truths of peace, justice and equality.</p>

Concord: Standing in Solidarity, Chartering a New Era (long version)

The theme for the inaugural Hwa Chong Global Digital Young Leaders Convention (HC-GDYLC) is Concord: Standing in Solidarity, Chartering a New Era. Just as how musical notes in concord come together to form a distinct harmony, a dynamic mix of people come forth during HC-GDYLC to assemble their individual ideas into a powerful and inspiring mosaic — as a testament to their shared experiences at the convention.

The birth of GDYLC comes fittingly in this new decade of unprecedented change, when more than ever, it is of utmost salience to bear in mind the universal values of partnership and unity have been the bedrock of human progress for centuries. The emergent trends in our global society seem to suggest that we are entering an era where insular national priorities pose a significant threat to sustained global cooperation. Young leaders therefore have a mammoth task thrust upon them: How shall we champion global cooperation against the backdrop of an increasingly polarised world?

With the rise of protectionism, nations have increasingly chosen to isolate themselves to safeguard their own vested interests. Coupled with how new media has radically transformed the way civil groups and governments interact, there is potential for an echo chamber where users are only exposed to views that support their own to be created. Not only does this further restrict the positive cross-pollination of ideas across boundaries, but it also has significant consequences in times of global adversity— such as the phenomenon of rising extremist terrorism and most recently, the COVID-19 global health crisis. The world is in a precarious position: clouded by fear and often influenced by the deluge of misinformation, the propensity for blaming an outgroup instead of focusing on mitigating the problem is very real. Leaders of some countries incorrectly believe that certain issues are exclusive only to a certain group, but fail to realise that our interconnectedness means that the problem of one group will invariably and inevitably become a global issue as well. Hence, all countries need to recognise that adopting such a mindset is counter-productive to solving the root of the issue, and that in the long run, synergistic cooperation is key for efficient and effective problem-solving when new challenges arise, regardless of country.

However, it is also crucial that we recognise that the current situation is certainly less bleak than it seems.Talk about how COVID is merely a trigger factor/ wake up call for us to stand in solidarity and rethink of systems Whilst the global berth may seem to have widened, many have stood in solidarity to confront the problems plaguing the world today. We live in an era of epochal change, where we have the autonomy to determine the way we want our systems to work and our ideas to be built upon one another from the ground-up. This is markedly evident when we note how an increasing number of progressive young leaders are taking over the political helm, shaping policies in accordance with the world’s changing priorities. The world’s youngest Prime Minister of Finland, Sanna Marin, has recently shed new light on climate reform, pioneering the idea of how the fight against climate change need not be a burden, but can instead be transformed into a budding economic opportunity. With fresh-faced leaders establishing their revolutionary visions for the next decade, it ignites confidence that we will be able to keep up the progress to mitigate our potential conflicts. 

In response to a less top-down approach to governance, those on the ground need to harness the benefits of a more transparent and open democracy by bringing their ideas to the forefront. Beyond the political sphere, a new generation of inspiring youth activists are spurring change in unison around the world. "I want you to act like your house is on fire, because it is." said Greta Thunberg at the World Economic Forum last year. The 17 year old face of the environmentalist movement has spearheaded climate strikes of unprecedented scale, uniting millions of youth to demand bold climate action from political leaders. Yang Ji-hye, a fierce advocate for gender equality in South Korea has brought momentum to the #MeToo movement in South Korea, shining a spotlight on the sexually inappropriate treatment girls in school suffer by organising protests to ensure the voices of the oppressed young girls are heard, even testifying before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child on the various forms of sexual harassment and violence Korean teens are subjected to in classrooms.  The voices of youth have incontrovertibly been amplified, and their concerns have been heard as they helm global movements that command the world’s attention. But how effective have they been in translating thought into concrete political action from the authorities? Despite the ascendancy of environmentalism, COP25 concluded in disappointment as conflicting nations failed to agree on many intended outcomes, such as rules to set up a global carbon trading system. Although the South Korean government has opened up official channels for student victims to report sexual abuse, how effective would these measures be in a world muddled by the ‘he-said, she-said’ narrative?

Given governments’ responsibility to grow the economy, this core conflict of interest with sustainable growth appears to be an unsolvable quandary. The events of this year have only proven that we can no longer prioritise absolute growth over our collective welfare. When crisis strikes, those on the bottom rungs of the economuc level are hit the hardest, and we It is thus inherent that the global industry continually innovates and revolutionises the economy in steps towards building a sustainable one. Whilst the opportunity cost for economic growth seems to be invariably linked back to environmental sustainability, as more than 80% of the world’s energy used for economic development still overwhelmingly relies on burning fossil fuels - the main perpetrator of global warming, societies can find a way out by pushing forward with the expansion of green industries and adoption of responsible production practices such as recycling to better meet our energy demands and work towards the goal of a circular economy. The global community can also better harness the untapped power and resources of the other half of the global population - women. By providing equally competent women with the same work opportunities as men, promoting gender equality will inevitably generate sustainable economic growth, with the skills of women better utilised and the creation of a community more gender-equalised.


Education is another frontier in the long road towards sustainability. In efforts to increase the accessibility of education worldwide, increasing partnerships and collaboration could hold the key to the problem, especially in developing countries. The multi-stakeholder framework by The Partnering Initiative that seeks to help countries find sustainable solutions to education involves businesses, NGOs, development agencies and the government. In Kenya, the Information Communication and Technology Trust Fund was set up to mobilise and channel ICT resources to Kenyan educational institutions. Funded by private sector partners including Microsoft, it was implemented with the coordination of government, as well as members of the public, helping to greatly increase accessibility of education to children across the nation. Providing more children with education is to provide not just the children, but their families a path to break out of the cycle of poverty as they grow up educated with the competencies to work in better-paying skills-based jobs. This ground-breaking mindset can also be emulated in countries with comprehensive education systems in place, fundamentally changing the ideology surrounding education and schooling, where education will no longer be about preparing students to take tests set by bureaucrats who are not fully aware of the complexities of society. By involving businesses who better understand the job world, they can empower and enable students to be more prepared for the uncertain future. The potential of these stakeholders are limitless. It is of the essence that numerous stakeholders are involved in providing education to ensure wider perspectives are considered to create more rounded curriculums that better prepare future generations of the world for the journey ahead.

The new decade brings the promise of actualising many lofty ambitions, but we must ensure that these goals are carried out with sufficient follow-through. The time is now for us to explore novel solutions, creating resilient and sustainable communities. Let us revitalise our global partnerships by standing together to eradicate unsustainable practices and uplift marginalised societies. In this new decade, it is necessary that we forge continuously forward in the fight to uphold the fundamental human values of care, justice and equality. Let us come together, stand in solidarity and set forth to charter our new era.
